# Diabetes Risk Prediction

## Introduction
Approximately 50% of people with diabetes are undiagnosed due to its long period of asymptomatic phase (Islam et al.,2020). Early detection of diabetes is therefore crucial.
<br>
<br>
This project aims to predict the likelihood of having diabetes using the data of newly diabetic and potentially diabetic patients from Sylhet Diabetes Hospital in Bangladesh.
